A pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design - in our case - in writing JavaScript web applications.

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

Design patterns are advanced object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. Each pattern has a name and becomes part of a vocabulary when discussing complex design solutions.

## Standardization

JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript is a dynamic programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.

JavaScript (at least the strict subset asm.js) is also considered an "assembly language of the web" – a compile target of source-to-source compilers – for making client side web applications, using other programming languages, supported by all the major browsers without plug-ins.

It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
